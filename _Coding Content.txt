Iteration Methods:
Fixed-Point 
Newton's Method
Secant optional

Interpolation:
Newton's Divided Difference (Forward and Backward) 
Lagrange Polynomial 
	error n = f(x) - Pn(x). at discrete points, error needs to be 0. Would also work.
Spline 
	keep dynamic. cubic spline.

Numerical Linear Algebra:
Gauss Elimination skip
LU-Factorization skip

Gauss keep, skip jacobi.
least square method skip

eiganvalue QR
